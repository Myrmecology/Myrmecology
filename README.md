# üëã Hi, I'm Justin

I'm a systems-oriented developer with a deep interest in all facets of computer science. My primary language of choice is **Rust**, which I leverage for its safety, performance, and modern design. I also work extensively with **C++** and **Python**, especially in performance-critical, scientific, and systems-level contexts.

## üß† Areas of Focus

- **Systems Programming**: Building performant, reliable software with Rust and C++
- **Scientific Computing**: Exploring how code can push the boundaries of research and analysis
- **Open Source Collaboration**: Contributing to projects that improve the developer ecosystem
- **Modern Web Technologies**: Prototyping full-stack applications using JavaScript/TypeScript and the MERN stack

## üå± Always Learning

I'm constantly exploring the intersection of low-level engineering and high-level design. Whether it‚Äôs dissecting a CPU architecture, contributing to open source, or experimenting with modern web frameworks, I'm driven by curiosity and precision.
